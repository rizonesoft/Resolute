Description
--------------------------------------------------

Edge is known for its speed and features, but it can also be a memory hog. If you've noticed Edge consuming excessive amounts of RAM, you're not alone. Edge can easily use hundreds of megabytes of memory, especially with multiple tabs and extensions running.

We like keeping our apps running for extended periods, and Edge's memory usage can grow significantly over time. It's common for Edge to use substantial memory right from the start, and this usage increases the longer the browser runs with multiple tabs and extensions active.

Rather than accepting this limitation, we created a solution. Enter Edgemin; it will help manage Edge's memory usage effectively. We've adapted our proven memory optimization engine specifically for Edge (including Edge extensions and processes). To use Edgemin, simply extract the files, double click on Edgemin.exe and let Edgemin optimize Edge's memory footprint. You expected it to be more complicated, we are truly sorry to disappoint you.
