Description
--------------------------------------------------

USB Repair will attempt to restore your USB devices when they stop working or if your USB drive fails to install. USB Repair is also a likely solution to several other Device Manager error codes.

When experiencing USB issues, you normally consider reinstalling Windows or restoring it to a previously functional version using System Restore. However, this will not be necessary when using this tool. USB Repair intends to help you avoid taking radical measures that are time consuming and can cost you.

Hopefully, USB Repair will solve your USB issues, but it is not guaranteed to work. There are a thousand things that can go wrong with your USB ports, including physical hardware damage, USB Repair attempts to solve USB configuration errors and nothing more.

Before running USB Repair, please create a System Restore point first, just for in case something goes wrong. You can create a System Restore Point by clicking on the Create a Windows Restore Point menu item under the Tools menu on the main program interface.

In conclusion, please do not run USB Repair if you are not experiencing USB related issues, you could break something.
