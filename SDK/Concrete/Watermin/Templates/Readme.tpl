Description
--------------------------------------------------

Waterfox is known for its speed and features, but it can also be a memory hog. If you've noticed Waterfox consuming excessive amounts of RAM, you're not alone. Waterfox can easily use hundreds of megabytes of memory, especially with multiple tabs and extensions running.

We like keeping our apps running for extended periods, and Waterfox's memory usage can grow significantly over time. It's common for Waterfox to use substantial memory right from the start, and this usage increases the longer the browser runs with multiple tabs and extensions active.

Rather than accepting this limitation, we created a solution. Enter Watermin; it will help manage Waterfox's memory usage effectively. We've adapted our proven memory optimization engine specifically for Waterfox (including Waterfox extensions and processes). To use Watermin, simply extract the files, double click on Watermin.exe and let Watermin optimize Waterfox's memory footprint. You expected it to be more complicated, we are truly sorry to disappoint you.
