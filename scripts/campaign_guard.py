"""The campaign run guard: its lifecycle commands and the driven
self-test for the Stop hook (D00 T04 §32, §34).

`.claude/hooks/campaign-stop.ps1` blocks the campaign session's end of
turn while its run is open. The guard file it reads is written and
deleted only through this module (D00 T04 §34):

    python scripts/campaign_guard.py acquire --session S --phase N --run-file F --cron-id J [--handover REASON]
    python scripts/campaign_guard.py end --session S --reason closeout|park|plan-done|operator-stop|escalation
    python scripts/campaign_guard.py hook-error
    python scripts/campaign_guard.py --self-test

`acquire` creates the guard exclusively; the owning session may re-point
it (a new phase or job) by compare-and-swap on `session_id`, and another
session is refused a live guard unless the operator hands it over.
`end` checks the end path's marker in the run file (a `## Closeout`
heading, a column-0 `PARKED` line, `0 runnable now`, or nothing for an
operator stop), then deletes the guard file and the state file and
names the heartbeat job still to `CronDelete`. `hook-error` prints and
clears an error the hook recorded, for the heartbeat to report. Every
command takes `--root` to act on a fixture workspace instead of this
repository.

The self-test drives the real hook with Stop payloads against a
throwaway workspace (a git repository, a guard file, a run file, and a
fake `scripts/todo-graph.py` whose runnable count the test controls) and
asserts every allow and block case, the stall breaker, and the
lifecycle commands.
