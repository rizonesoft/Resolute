Description
--------------------------------------------------

Before you think "Not another Memory Booster / Optimizer", Rizonesoft Memory Booster is not just another Memory Booster. And yes, I know that many software companies claim that they have the solution to never upgrading memory again. First of all, most of these companies are full of it, most of them rely on the placebo effect, this is, if you think it is going to work, it will. Also, most of them will try and optimize your system by forcing memory out of RAM.

Rizonesoft Memory Booster does not run on the placebo memory optimization engine and will not force any memory out of your RAM. It will however make a safe Windows API call that tells Windows to clean up the workspace of all processes thus freeing up any memory, processes no longer needs (Clear Processes Working Set). It will do this periodically to help improve the speed and the stability of your system.

Keep in mind that this method will not free up a big amount of RAM, but instead will, as previously stated, improve the stability and performance of your computer. This will also cure memory leaks and in some cases has been able to unfreeze programs. Because it uses a Windows API call, you know that it’s safe to run. Memory booster will now also force processes trying to hog all your processor power to calm down a little. It will scan all open processes; when a process with a priority of above normal is found, it will set it to normal. In turn this will free up some needed processing power.
