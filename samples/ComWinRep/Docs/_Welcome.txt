Windows has this nasty little habit of breaking down, mostly because of malicious software. Normally malware uses a feature of Windows called policies to lock you out of certain functions. If that was not bad enough, malware also uses other techniques or configuration changes to make life suck just a little more. Apart from all of this, you also need to deal with file corruption and other badly programmed applications messing things up. With millions of things that can go wrong with your Windows computer, the 100 or so solutions are just not adequate. Complete Windows Repair tries to fill the gaps.
