Repair Windows 8/10 Component Store

The following commands are done.

Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup
Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

The first command cleans up the component store (WinSxS Folder) in windows, reducing it size and removing old entries.

The 2nd command is used to repair corrupt files and corrupt entries in the component store.

Reasons for this repair:
Used to fix Windows component store corruption when a SFC /SCANNOW command is unable to repair corrupted system files because the store (source) is corrupted, then run the SFC command again.
Used to fix Windows component store corruption when the same Windows Updates continue to appear to be available to install even though they already show successfully installed in update history.
