1. Description
-----------------------------------
Mute on Lock is a tiny resident utility that sits in the system tray
and monitors your session: when you are locking your Windows
workstation, it mutes the sound of your speakers. Do not want to
bother your colleagues by sounds of instant messenger, reminders or
leaving music when you are out? Use Mute on Lock and forget about
this problem! Moreover, with the help of this program you can quickly
mute or unmute the system sound by double-clicking the tray icon or
using an optional hot key.
