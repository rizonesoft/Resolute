Description
--------------------------------------------------

If you are a Windows Vista, 7, 8 or 8.1 user then you will know all about file ownership and permissions related issues.

These effected Windows versions has implemented an additional security mechanism to prevent accidental or intentional file or folder modification by not allowing users other than the owner of the file or folder to access it. Henceforth if you need to access, modify or delete such files or folders you need to take ownership first then assign rights or permission to respective users.

Taking ownership of files or folders is not a simple task. Whether you use the GUI or the command line, it takes far too many steps to take ownership of files or folders. Rizonesoft Ownership will add a "Take Ownership" option under the Explorer right-click menu that will handle all the steps for you. This menu option is used to modify the Discretionary Access Control lists (DACLs). Simply put, it unlocks or gets ownership of a file or folder.

Note: After you have taken ownership of the item, you may still need to allow your user account Full Control of the item before you will have permission to access, modify, or delete it.
