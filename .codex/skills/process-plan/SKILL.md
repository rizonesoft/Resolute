description: Front door for todo/implementation-plan.md. Audit the plan, then run process-phase on the first phase with a ready row, then the next ready phase after each closeout or park. Use when the user says process the plan. The argument --audit is audit only. A named phase is one phase and does not chain.

# Process the Implementation Plan

The only front door for `todo/implementation-plan.md` when the user did not name a single phase. The file is a generated projection of the 100% complete development plan (small, single-responsibility sections and granular micro-steps): processing it is not "pick a row and improvise", and it is not "tick the boxes".

This skill does not ship a section and does not write a stamp. It audits, then chains `process-phase` runs until the plan is 100% complete or every leftover row is blocked here. Writes stay serial: the run this skill starts is the only writer on the tree.

## The loop

One continuous loop. You do not stop between sections or phases:

1. Audit (below), then start `process-phase` on the first phase with a ready row, in this same turn.
2. After that phase's closeout or park, re-run `python scripts/todo-graph.py query ready` and start the next ready phase.
3. Stop only when no phase has a ready row: every remaining `[ ]` row is blocked or waiting in this context, or the plan is done. That, and an operator stop, are the only halts.

A report to the operator is not a stop. An audit-only reply while a ready phase exists is a process defect: starting the phase is the next action, in the same turn. The self-correcting parts stay in the loop: drifted plan claims are corrected before building (inside `process-todo-section`), every gap and review leftover files through `add-todo`, and red gates are fixed, never bypassed (no `--no-verify`, no amend of a reviewed candidate, no force-push).

## The run guard holds this loop open

`scripts/run-guard.py` (hooks in `.claude/settings.json`, rules in `scripts/lib/run_guard.py`) enforces the loop above: the prompt `process plan` switches it on, the Stop hook sends a turn back while runnable rows remain, a `CronCreate` heartbeat wakes an idle session, and the scheduled task resumes a dead one, never beside a live session in this repository. It ends only on an operator stop, a normal exit, no runnable rows, a stall (repeated attempts changing nothing) or a recorded halt: `python scripts/run-guard.py halt --ground <data-loss|credentials|shared-infrastructure|wrong-calculation|operator> --reason <why>`. A gate that cannot stamp a section is not a ground: record it, file the owner item and take the next row; a section whose last completion review returned gaps no longer counts as runnable. Check with `python scripts/run-guard.py status`. On a new machine run `python scripts/run-guard.py install` once.

## 0. Route

```powershell
git status -sb
python scripts/todo-graph.py validate
python scripts/todo-graph.py query ready
```

| State | Do this |
| ----- | ------- |
| Another writer holds the tree | Stop and say so; never run two writers on one tree. |
| Argument is `--audit` | Run the audit below, then stop. Do not start a run. |
| Argument is a phase (`0`, `Phase 0`) | Run `process-phase` for that phase only; do not chain. |
| Empty argument, "the plan", or path | Audit below, then chain ready phases. |

## 1. Audit the whole plan

```powershell
python scripts/todo-graph.py validate
python scripts/todo-graph.py plan --check
python scripts/todo-graph.py query ready
python scripts/todo-graph.py query blocked
python scripts/todo-graph.py query stats
python -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests
```

Fix every validator refusal before talking about shipping. If `plan --check` is stale, run `plan --sync` and re-check. The deep phase repair belongs to `process-phase` step 1; this audit is the commands above plus five recorded lines in the first phase's run file (`docs/phase-runs/<date>-phase-<N>.md`), not as the turn's last words:

1. Graph: valid section count, or the refusal.
2. Plan currency: the `--check` result.
3. Ready rows: count and first ref per phase.
4. Blocked rows: count and what blocks them (unmet dependencies, waiting Needs, unreachable hosts).
5. The phase being started, and why it is first.

Ready means runnable now in this context: `query ready` already excludes rows waiting on dependencies, inactive files and waiting Needs; `process-phase` re-checks each row with `resolve` rather than trusting a previous list.

If no phase has a ready row, report the leftovers with their blockers and stop. That is a genuine halt.

## 2. After a phase closeout or park

`process-phase` ends in exactly one of three ways: the phase table is all `[x]` with a written closeout; every leftover is blocked here and it parked (a `PARKED` line and park record in its run file); or the operator paused it. A parked phase is not complete and not a stall. Do not call it either.

Re-run `python scripts/todo-graph.py query ready`. If another phase has a ready row, start `process-phase` on it in the same turn, same session, same rules. If none does, report which: plan done, or the leftovers and their blockers, with the run files named.

## Deny

- Do not invent a side loop that ships rows outside `process-todo-section` plus `review-todo-section`.
- Do not start a second run, and do not resume a paused run unless the operator said resume.
- Do not tick `implementation-plan.md` by hand, and do not edit it at all: it is generated.
- Do not claim a phase complete while its table has `[ ]` rows.
- Do not treat a named phase as the whole plan. Chaining is this skill's job, and only this skill's.
- Do not end the turn on the audit table.
